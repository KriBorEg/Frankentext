Title: Frankentext generator

The program reads the contents of Frankenstein.txt, tokenizes the text into words, and builds a successor map — 
a structure that records which words tend to follow which others.
Using this data, it generates new sentences that start with a capitalized word and end when a word ends with ., !, or ?.

How it works: 

All non-printable characters in the book are replaced with spaces.
The text is split into tokens (words) using delimiters like spaces and newlines.
Each unique token is stored in the tokens array, and their relationships (successors) are recorded.

A sentence begins with a randomly chosen word that starts with a capital letter.
Each next word is selected randomly from the current word’s list of successors.

Sentence generation stops when:

  1. A word ends with ., !, or ?
  2. The sentence reaches the buffer limit.
